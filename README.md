### What dope technologies does this use
A computer vision API along with Node.js is used to thugify images

* [Project Oxford for Node](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/project-oxford) calls the Microsoft Face API to return angle, pitch, and coordinates of eyes and eyebrows for each face detected,

* Socket.io is also used here for a connection between the client and the node server

* Animations are handled using jQuery.

* Some music is also played automatically. So just turn down the volume if not required.(Music is important for the feel of the project)

## I believe, When science and memes come together, something wonderful and funky is made!
